# GTuner

A guitar tuner app made with flutter

Current Platforms include:
- Android

Can support other platforms

Implemented so far:
- Tuning functionality
- Chord Library

Remaining:
- Metronome (Challenging because it requires an accurate Timer. Timer function in dart is not accurate enough)
- Songs (A catalogue of songs to be displayed in the app, with each song having its own tabs)
